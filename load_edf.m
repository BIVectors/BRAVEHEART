% Deal with Physionet .EDF exports that have extra missing data appended on

% info.DigitalMin, so to be robust for different databases need to just
% look at the final sample value and use that.  The artifact is a single
% value, so regardless of what the value is can look for long flat segments

% lead it has to be in the other leads too to keep them the same length
