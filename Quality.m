classdef Quality
% Tries to flag annotation results which are suspicious or unlikely to be correct
% This is not 100% specific or sensitive, but ECGs which are flagged by the detector are generally worth reviewing
% The properties below are checked to see if they are too high or too low; if so the ECG is flagged
% High/low limits are set in Qualparams.m or Qualparams.csv (if deployed)
% Separately there is a estimate of probability that the ECG is of good
% quality based on logistic regression
% Information on the sensitivity/specificity etc can be found in the documentation

% The parameters in Quality should match those in Qualparams except for:
% 1. prob_value
% 2. nnet_flag
% 3. nnet_flag
% 4. missing_lead
% Which are Quality flags that are not set in Qualparams
