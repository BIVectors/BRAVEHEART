%speed defined as the speed going to point n (eg distance of pt n minues pt n-1
%Therefore point 1 will have no speed (because no point 0).  This
%prevents the last point from having speed undefined -- but it is a matter
%of convention.  Because speed_3d(n) is the speed between point n-1 going
%to point n, we define the "time" of this point as sample (n + (n-1))/2, or
%the time between these 2 points.  eg, speed_3d(2) is the speed between
%points 1 -> 2.  Because times starts at 0 but samples start at 1, the
%timing assigned to speed_3d(n) is the average of TIME n-2 and n-1.
%Therefore, if freq is 500 Hz and each sample is 2 ms, then speed(2) is the
%speed between time 0 ms (sample 1) and time 2 ms (sample 2) = 1 ms.  If
%Freq is 1000 hz, then speed_3d(3) is the speed between sample 2 (time
%point 1 = 1 ms) and sample 3 (time point 2 = 2 ms) and is equal to 1.5 ms.
