function n = findHighpassLvl(cut,fs)

% Finds the first wavelet decomposition level BELOW 'cut' Hz given the
% sampling frequency 'fs' Hz

L = 1:1:20;             % Max level 20 - should be more than enough
C = fs./(2.^(L+1));     % Calc freq cutoffs for all levels
ind = find(C < cut);    % Find levels below cutpt

n = ind(1);             % Find first level below cutpt
