## What is BRAVEHEART?
BRAVEHEART (Beth Israel Analysis of Vectors of the Heart) is a modular, customizable, open-source software package for processing electrocardiograms (ECGs) and vectorcardiograms (VCGs) for research purposes.  
BRAVEHEART was built using MATLAB and **requires a version after R2022a** (http://www.mathworks.com) as well as the following toolboxes to run via source code:
* Wavelet toolbox
* Signal processing toolbox
* Deep learning toolbox
* Parallel computing toolbox (optional)

For users without access to MATLAB or all required toolboxes, we have also provided executables for Windows and Mac operating systems that can be run without needing MATLAB installed.

The most up to date version of the software can be found on GitHub at http://www.github.com/BIVectors/BRAVEHEART, where the software, source code, and executables for Windows and Mac are available under version 3 of the General Public License (GPL) (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

## Installation & User Guide/Software Methods
[![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/User%20Guide-F7DF1E?logo=adobeacrobatreader&style=flat&labelColor=555)](https://github.com/BIVectors/BRAVEHEART/blob/main/braveheart_userguide.pdf)   
A detailed user guide that covers installation and use of the software, including a quick start guide and examples of ECG/VCG processing, is available in the file [braveheart_userguide.pdf](https://github.com/BIVectors/BRAVEHEART/blob/main/braveheart_userguide.pdf).  

[![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Methods%20Manuscript-F7DF1E?logo=elsevier&style=flat&logoColor=white&labelColor=555)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107798)    
A manuscript describing the software methods in detail is available in the file [braveheart_methods.pdf](https://github.com/BIVectors/BRAVEHEART/blob/main/braveheart_methods.pdf) and as a [manuscript in Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107798)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107798). 

## Frequently Encountered Issue - GUI Not Displaying Correctly
If the GUI is not displaying completely first check that your **monitor resolution is at least 1920 x 1080**.  If your monitor resolution is adequate but the GUI is still not fully displaying, 
your computer display settings likely have some form of scaling turned on; this setting increases the size of text to improve readability, but also effectively reduces the screen resolution.
Instructions for how to disable this setting can be found below or in the user guide section 29.1:

To disable screen scaling:   
+ **Windows 10:** Open the Ease of Access settings with Windows key + U. Under
Make everything bigger on the Display tab, change to 100%.   
+ **Windows 11:** Open Settings and then Display. Under Scale & layout, expand the Scale
menu and change to 100%.   
+ **Mac OS:** Open System Preferences and then Display. Choose Scaled Resolution and then
More Space

## Supported ECG Formats:
BRAVEHEART can read a wide variety of 12-lead ECG formats including:
1. GE MUSE XML
2. Philips XML
3. HL7 XML
4. DICOM
5. ISHNE
6. GE Marquette ASCII
7. Cardiosoft XML
8. Schiller XML
9. SCP-ECG
10. EDF
11. Physionet .dat
12. Physionet .csv
