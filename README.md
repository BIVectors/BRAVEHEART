## What is BRAVEHEART?
BRAVEHEART (Beth Israel Analysis of Vectors of the Heart) is a modular, customizable, open-source software package for processing electrocardiograms (ECGs) and vectorcardiograms (VCGs) for research purposes.  
BRAVEHEART was built using MATLAB and **requires a version after R2022a** (http://www.mathworks.com) as well as the following toolboxes to run via source code:
* Wavelet toolbox
* Signal processing toolbox
* Deep learning toolbox
* Parallel computing toolbox (optional)

For users without access to MATLAB or all required toolboxes, we have also provided executables for Windows and Mac operating systems that can be run without needing MATLAB installed.

The most up to date version of the software can be found on GitHub at http://www.github.com/BIVectors/BRAVEHEART, where the software, source code, and executables for Windows and Mac are available under version 3 of the General Public License (GPL) (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
