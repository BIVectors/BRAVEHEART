function baseline = baseline_voltage(med_vcg, medianbeat)

% Calculates the baseline voltage at the end of the T wave primarily for
% quality metrics.

% Look at 30 ms after the end of the T wave
d = 30;
extra = round(d * med_vcg.hz/1000);     % Round to deal with random freq like 997 Hz

% How many samples are left after T end
leftover = length(med_vcg.VM) - medianbeat.Tend;

if leftover >= extra
    baseline = median(med_vcg.VM(medianbeat.Tend+1:medianbeat.Tend+extra)); 
else
% if less than 30 ms at the end of the signal, take to end
    baseline = median(med_vcg.VM(medianbeat.Tend+1:end)); 
end
