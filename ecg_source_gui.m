function [freq, wavelet_level_selection, wavelet_level_selection_lf] = ecg_source_gui(freq)

% wavelet_level_selection_lf is really the value here + 5; eg 5 -> lvl 10, 6 -> lvl 11
% Now sets the HPF denoising to highest level that is < 0.25 Hz

% To get wavelet_level_selection_lf from findHighpassLvl(cut,fs) function
% take output and substract 5
