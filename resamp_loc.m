function idx = resamp_loc(fa, f0, sa)

% fa is the frequency of the signal that was annotated (usually at 500 Hz)
% f0 is the frequency of the original signal before resampling (to 500 Hz)
% sa is the index of the selected fiducial point in the annotated signal (500 Hz)

% For example, if use an ECG that is sampled at 1000 Hz, it will be
% downsampled to 500 Hz for NN annotation, fa = 500, and f0 = 1000.
% If used an ECG that is sampled at 250 Hz, it will be upsampled to 500 Hz
% for NN annotation, fa = 500, and f0 = 250.

% For the current implementation of BRAVEHEART, fa = 500

% Each sample has distance of 1/freq

if isnan(sa) || isempty(sa)
    idx = nan;
    return
end

% Distance to the selected point in the annotated signal (starting from sample 1)
Da = (sa-1)/fa;

% Want to find the index of the point in the new signal that is closest to Da
idx = round(f0*Da)+1;

% This will round DOWN when a point is equidistant from 2 points on the
% original signal.
