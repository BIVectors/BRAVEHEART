    % Find the end of an ECG wave which has its peak at pk

    % fsprime is derivative of the EKG signal
    % look btw pk and endw
    % Finds the wave end using a derivative threshold
    % the threshold depends on the max slope and the type of wave a la Laguna 1994
    % type can be 'P', 'T', 'S', 'R'
