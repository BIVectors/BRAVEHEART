% (feature to be added in future)

% auto determines the appropriate level for each lead based on the frequency of the HR
% removes frequencies lower than HR frequency
if wavelet_level_lf == 0

end


% wavelet reconstruction using wavelet and level specified by user.  
% levels 8-10 seem to work well and correspond to freq of respiration in most ppl    
% this gives the approximation at level n approximation as the estimate of the baseline wander (A_signal)
