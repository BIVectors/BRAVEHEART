% QRS: indices of peaks in signal
% endspikes: vector, location of pacing spikes if present
% then either specify:
% QRsamp: vector, optional, specify the number of samples before each QRS to set the annotation window
% RSsamp: vector, optional, specify the number of samples after each QRS to set the annotation window
% STstartsamp, STendsamp: analogous to above
% or:
% autoMF: flag, try to estimate annotation windows automatically
% autoMF_thresh: median filtering threshold % to estimate QRS width
% filter_width: width of the median filter
% other parameters passed through to autoMF.

% if windows aren't specified, autoMFannotate tries to set sensible detection windows around each QRS.
% These detection windows are used as guardrails for the heuristic QRS annotator, annoMF
% this is done by using a median filter to estimate the width of each QRS
