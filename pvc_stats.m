%%% INPUT
% corr_threshold = normalized cross correlation trehsold for comparison of PVC
% and normal (nominal 0.95)
% rmes_threshold = normalized cross correlation trehsold for comparison of PVC
% and normal (nominal 0.1)
% keep_pvc = keep (1) or remove (0) PVCs

% strings/char) for all beats
% ecg_matrix = matrix of all 15 ecg leads
% median_beats = matrix of all beats making up the median VM beat
%%% OUTPUT
% delete_index = indices of beats to delete based on if want to keep/remove
% PVCs
% norm_corr_matrix_values =  matrix of normalized cross correlation values for
% all beats
% pvc_marker = beats that are declared as PVC (1) or normal (0)
% VM_no_PVC = signal with PVC beatsreplaced by nan


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% NEW METHOD
% Looks at X, Y, Z leads individually
% calculates the cross correlation and RMSE for all combinations of beats (NxN)
% values of corr and RMSE are thresholded into 1 and 0, and then added together
% If either RMSE or Xcorr meet criteria, it is considered a NORMAL beat
% The beat that agrees best with all other beats is chosen as the reference
% This beat is used to calculate the correlation with all other beats and
% the XCorr and RMSE is calculated.
% If there are more than N/2 + 1 normal beats, the PVCs are the rest
% If there are < N/2 + 1 normal beats (eg bigeminy), the normal beat is the
% narrower template
% Beats.m class then calculates the X, Y, Z PVCs.  Beats that have >= 2
% leads showing PVC are noted to be a PVC


% Assign current listbox beats to prior fiducial points Q, QRS, S, Tend
Q = beatmatrix(:,1);
R = beatmatrix(:,2);
S =  beatmatrix(:,3);
Tend = beatmatrix(:,4);

QRS = beatmatrix(:,3) - beatmatrix(:,1);
QT = beatmatrix(:,4) - beatmatrix(:,1);

N = numel(Q);  % number of beats

% There cannot be a PVC if there is only 1 beat
% If run with 1 beat will crash - so if N = 1 will just break out

if N <= 1   
    delete_index = [];
    norm_corr_matrix_values = [];
    rmse_matrix_values = [];
    pvc_marker = false(N,1)';
    max_index = [];
    
    return;
end

% Calc beatsig - individual beats so PVC detector can operate on the properly aligned beats
% Specifically NOT using the parsed out individual beats that made up the
% median beat because need to look at a segment around QRS peak that is
% relatively shorter than the entire QRST complex, or noise etc makes the
% cross correlations poor overall

[startb, endb] = minQRSTwindow(Q, R, S, Tend);

for i=1:N
   % figure(i)
   % hold on

norm_corr_matrix = zeros(N);

% Need to clip the parts of the QRS complex that will be used to see how
% correlated 2 beats are.  This is because if the windows arent equal cant
% computer correlation, and truncating to the shorter signal can cause
% errors due to not knowing if should truncate the start or end of the
% signal (? is signal A too long at start or end compared to signal B).
% Will take each QRS interval, and truncate around the R wave to the
% shortest RS and QR intervals

% Start with beat 1, and compare its normalized correlation and RMSE to all other
% beats in the beatlist using the adjusted QR and RS intervals
